The committee was composed of Quezon City officials to lead the said committee – QC Mayor as the Chairman, QC Vice Mayor as the Co-chairman, QC Chairman of the Committee on Education as the Vice-Chairman. At the same time, the QC Treasurer, Director of the Bureau of Higher Education (Department of Education, Culture and Sports), a former University of the Philippines President, representatives from Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, Technological University of the Philippines and Polytechnic University of the Philippines, and four members of the City Council were part of the technical committee as members.\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nAs the result of the studies and to kick-off the establishment of Quezon City’s Local University, the Quezon City Polytechnic was created on March 1, 1994, by the virtue of the City Council Ordinance No. SP-0171 for the training and development of skilled and technical workers. Three-year Associate Programs were introduced in the Polytechnic on Academic Year 1994-1995, which were designed to develop highly competent technicians for the industry in Automotive Technology, Electrical Technology, Welding Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology, and Fashion Technology. The institution offered additional three-year Associate Programs for Electronics Technology, Mechanical Technology or Machine Shop, Computer Technology, and an industry-led pilot course in Boiler Technology in the following Academic Year. The Polytechnic established its reputation among local government units as a show window and model technology-based institution paving the way for its recognition of the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) and developing a strong alliance with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nIn 1997, the SP-544, S-97 has been passed by the Quezon City Council, which authorized the City Government to establish its own Higher Education Institution by enhancing existing Quezon City Polytechnic – Pamantansang Politekniko ng Lungsod Quezon or Quezon City Polytechnic University. After years of preparations and budget allocations, the Quezon City Council enacted City Ordinance No. SP-1030, S-2001, providing for the Charter and the formal establishment of Pamantasang Politeknikal ng Lungsod Quezon or Quezon City Polytechnic University and strengthened its management.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nThe University started offering bachelor’s degree programs for Entrepreneurial Management, Industrial Engineering, and Information Technology in the Academic Year of 2005-2006. The Quezon City Council amended the University’s Charter in 2009 through the enactment of City Ordinance, SP-1945, S-2009. This is to provide further fiscal and administrative autonomy to the University, which helped the institution to optimize its academic initiatives and creativity. This ordinance allowed the University to enhance its bachelor’s degree offerings; the curriculums of Information Technology and Entrepreneurship (previously known in the University as Entrepreneurial Management) programs have been improved in AY 2010-2011. In the following Academic Year, the university’s bachelor’s degree program for Electronics Engineering has been offered.\r\n</p>'),
